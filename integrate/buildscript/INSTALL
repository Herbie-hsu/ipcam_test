This file shows how to build our project under 'buildscript' directory.

Follow these steps to build all images:
	make sn98360_336mhz_sf_defconfig
	make
	make install
All the image files can been found under image.

Otherwise build a single image according to the following steps:
1. initialize building environment:
You must select a config file which lies under 'buildscript/scripts/configs/' directory, ex: sn98360_336mhz_sf_defconfig:
	make sn98360_336mhz_sf_defconfig

2. show what kind of modules you can build:
After initialization environment,if you don't know what kind of modules you can build,just execute command:
	make showmodules
All the modules displayed can been builded singly,for example:
	make u-boot-2011-09

3. build UBOOT.bin
UBOOT.bin depends on u-boot.bin which need to be builded firstly,so do it as following:
	make u-boot-2011-09
Now you have got u-boot.bin,then UBOOT.bin can be gotten by commands:
	make bootimage

3. build KERNEL.bin
KERNEL.bin depends on uImage which need to be builded firstly,so do it as following:
	make linux-2.6.35.12
Now you have got uImage,then KERNEL.bin can be gotten by commands:
	make kernelimage

3. build ROOTFS-R.bin
ROOTFS-R.bin depends on rootfs.cramfs which need to be builded firstly,so do it as following:
	make rootfs
Now you have got rootfs.cramfs,then ROOTFS-R.bin can be gotten by commands:
	make rootfsimage

4. build FIRMWARE.bin
KERNEL.bin,ROOTFS-R.bin and UBOOT.bin is necessary for FIRMWARE.bin.When all the necessaries are prepared,you
can get FIRMWARE.bin by commands as following:
